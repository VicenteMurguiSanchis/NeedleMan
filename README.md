# NeedleMan
A game of the platform genre where the user must defeat waves of enemies that appear.

The game was made by the members of the UPV video game club in 2020.

I was in charge of the design and implementation of the movement and attacks of the main character and the behavior of the enemies.

In the files you can find all the code that was implemented along with the illustrations and audios that were used for the development of the game.
